### Welcome to Advanced Ruby!
<img align="right" src="http://peter.alschitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ruby-rails-sinatra.jpg"> We are super excited that you are joining us for another class. This class will be fast-paced and cover a lot of ground. Don't worry if you feel frustrated sometimes - we want to push you! The only way to see what you are really capable of is to stretch out your brain and challenge yourself. 

One of the most important things a programmer needs to learn is **persistence** and **resilience**. Banging your head against a wall until you get it right is a HUGE part of programming. The best programmers are good at what we call PEP. So when you get stuck, take a deep breath and remember to follow the three steps:

**Step 1** - Read the error message carefully and Google the problem.

**Step 2** - Ask a friend in the class or talk to the Rubber Duckie (I promise he will help!). 

**Step 3** - Ask the teacher for help.

We are always here to help, but learning to problem solve on your own is a REALLY important part of programming. When you figure out something on your own it sticks in your head even better than someone else explaining it. AND if you turn around and help a friend solve that same problem I guarantee you will never forget what you learned.

### Now let's get reaaaaaadddddy to Ruuuuuuby!

Weâ€™re going to spend the next few weeks taking your skills to the next level by building our own version of Twitter - Fwitter? - from the ground up. Before we get fancy though, we need to make sure that our foundation is solid. Today we'll get your basic Ruby skills back up to speed, review the principles of MVC, and start building our Sinatra project.
