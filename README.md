### Welcome to Advanced Ruby!
<img align="right" src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/net/uploads/legacy/943_sinatra/images/singing-with-sinatra.jpg"> We are super excited that you are joining us for another class. This class will be fast-paced and cover a lot of ground. Don't worry if you feel frustrated sometimes - we want to push you! The only way to stretch and learn and see what you are really capable of is to challenge yourself. 

One of the most important things a programmer needs to learn is **persistence** and **resilience**. Banging your head against a wall until you get it right is a HUGE part of programming. The best programmers are good at what we call PEP (Principles of Empowerment Protocol). So when you get stuck, take a deep breath and remember to follow the three steps:

**Step 1** - Read the error message carefully and Google the problem.
**Step 2** - Ask a friend in the class or talk to the Rubber Duckie (I promise he will help!). 
**Step 3** - Ask the teacher for help.

Now let's get reaaaaaadddddy to Ruuuuuuby!

Weâ€™re going to spend the next few weeks taking your skills to the next level by building our own version of Twitter - Fwitter? - from the ground up. Before we get fancy though, we need to make sure that our foundation is solid. Today we'll get your basic Ruby skills back up to speed, review the principles of MVC and start building our Sinatra MVC project.
